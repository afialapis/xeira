# xeira

> One web-dev-stack command to rule them all

`xeira` aims to group all the Web Dev stack processes you need from a single, zero config, command.
Under the hoods, it calls well know, community trusted tools:

  Â· linting trough [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
  - transpiling with [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
  - bundling with [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
  - serving dev servers both with [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) or [Nollup](https://github.com/PepsRyuu/nollup)
  - testing with [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai)

Future versions will try to add more tools (so, for example, letting you to pick your
preferred bundler). It's also very opinionated, using pretty standard configurations.
